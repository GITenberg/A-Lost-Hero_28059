<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE materials of heroism are everywhere;
each day and all situations
are full of them. The power to recognize
them and the will to use them
make the hero. He who saves life,
no matter how obscure, how poor, how
ignorant he may be, has a value which
can never belong to the spiller of blood;
and the crimson glories of war fade
before the white honors of peace.</div>

<p>This little story, which was originally
contributed to the "Youth's Companion,"
has sought to teach the young people
of America something of the grandeur
which waits upon a brave deed, and
something of the beauty of supreme
self-sacrifice.</p>

</div></td><td align='left'><div class='cap'>THE express from Columbia was due.
It was almost nine o'clock on Tuesday
night, the 31st of August, 1886. It
had been a hot day, sultry toward night,
and the loungers at the Summerville
station were divided between pitying
and envying their neighbors on the excursion
train. In such weather, home
seems either the most intolerable or the
most comfortable place in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It had not rained for six weeks, and
South Carolina panted.</div>

<p>There was a larger crowd
than usual at the little station
to see the Columbia
excursionists come in. The
enterprise of the Summerville
merchant who placarded
the pine-trees of this
forest village with legends
to the effect that his ice-cream
would be found "Opp.
the depot," was well rewarded
that scorching night. The
streets thronged&mdash;if Summerville
streets can ever be
said to throng&mdash;with warm
and thirsty loungers of both sexes and
of every color. South Carolinians
though they were, they objected to the
heat of that day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<td align='left'><p>In the group at the station stood
a white boy, about ten years old,&mdash;a
neatly dressed, well-behaved little fellow,
with an expression of crushing
and delightful
responsibility.
He wandered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
back and forth restlessly and proudly
from the track to a tree in the square,
where an old horse and wagon were
fastened with unnecessary security.
The boy tested the halter, and patted
the horse continually.</p>

<p>It was a very important thing to drive
two miles in the dark for one's father
and bring him home from the nine
o'clock express. Add to this situation
the excitement of an excursion, and
Donny de Mone felt that life lacked
nothing more to the position and the
dignity of manhood. Besides, Donny
was very fond of his father, and had not
seen him for two weeks.

<span class="caption">&quot;THE BOY TESTED THE HALTER, AND PATTED THE HORSE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Now, there was one curious thing
about this crowd which would have
been noticeable to a stranger, but had
not as yet attracted the attention of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
residents. This was the extraordinary
number of animals that seemed to be
waiting for this train. One would
have thought that half the dogs in the
neighborhood had relatives coming from
Columbia.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;STRAY GOATS AND MULES GAZED EXPECTANTLY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Stray goats and mules gazed
expectantly up and down the
track. Cats had followed
their owners from the
houses and betrayed their
devotion by subdued
squeals from under
their masters' regardless
heels. A
brindle-brown pig
wriggled its way
among the crowd,
grunting with persistent
uneasiness;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
while a couple of wandering cows, unmolested
by the strangely restless dogs,
passed and repassed the railroad crossing,
bellowing monotonously. The
horses at the station exhibited curious
discomfort; and Donny de Mone's
venerable nag "Ben Bow" astonished
the community by pulling at his
halter.</p>

<p>While the boy stood valiantly holding
the bridle, an old Negro came up and
pulled his sleeve. He was a shabby old
Negro. His lean knees protruded
through his trousers,&mdash;a mass of
patches from under which the original
material, like the jackknife in the mental
philosophy problem, had wholly disappeared.
It was especially noticeable
that tufts of white hair found their way
through the holes in his coon-skin cap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Across his shoulder he carried a bundle
knotted into an old red handkerchief
with a polka spot.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;AN OLD NEGRO CAME UP.&quot;</span>

<p>"Say, boss, cud ye tell me whar a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
poah niggah cud fine a bit o' kivered
hay to sleep on, an' a moufful o' pone

whar my dahter, Juno Soo, is a
dyin' ob fever. She ain't long foh dis
wohl. I'se got money 'nuff foh de
breffust."</p>

<p>He looked wistfully at the lad.
Donny answered with the heartiness of
a child who has been brought up to
think of others.</p>

<p>"My father will tell you when he
comes in. I expect him every minute.
But why don't you go to Kittie's."
He mentioned the name of a woman
well known in Summerville for strong
character and wise benevolence. "She
lives up the track there. Anybody will
show you. She'll help you; she's the
best colored woman in town."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;HE PLODDED SLOWLY UP THE TRACK.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The old man turned away without
answering. Perhaps he thought this
a pleasant device on the boy's part to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
get rid of him. Perhaps he meant to
follow his counsel. Who can say? He
plodded slowly up the track and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;SNAPPED HIS HALTER AND BROKE AWAY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<div class='cap'>NOW, while Donny stood holding
Ben Bow by the bridle, the old
horse reared, plunged violently, snapped
his halter, and
broke away.
The boy, at the same instant, was hurled
to the ground. The ringing of hoofs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and whir of wheels made strange sensations
in his ears. He thought what a
fool he was to be knocked down by old
Ben Bow.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/gs10.jpg" width="300" height="189" alt="&quot;HE GOT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND CRAWLED.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE GOT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND CRAWLED.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then he tottered to his feet. Complete
darkness had come. There was
an unearthly
silence. Then
a moan, then
a howl and a
shriek arose
which reached
from group to
group, from
house to house,
from square to forest. Human and
animal cries blended in one piteous
appeal for mercy.</p>

<p>Again the unknown power smote the
lad to the earth, which had become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a raging sea. It rocked&mdash;it rolled.
Terrified, the child no longer attempted
to stand. He got down on his hands
and knees and crawled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs11.jpg" width="500" height="455" alt="&quot;BIRDS SEEMED TO SING THROUGH THE AIR.&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>The trees whistled overhead. Flocks
of birds seemed to sing through the air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
striking against the telegraph wires.
The atmosphere, which but a few moments
ago reeked with heat, took on a
grave-like chill. Again the earth heaved
and swayed beneath the frightened
youngster, who fell upon his face, vainly
clawing the ground for the support
which it denied him.</p>

<p>The station was only twenty yards
away. There, all the people were in a
turmoil. While endeavoring to regain
their feet, some were violently thrown
upon the wooden platform. Others,
holding to the side of the building, felt
with stupefaction the boards totter beneath
their touch. Was judgment at
hand? Had the end of the world come?
The terror of a nameless danger unmanned
the stoutest heart. Women shrieked

<p>Donny had now joined the stricken
group. They huddled together until
another shock threw them one upon
another. Delicate women became nauseated
as if in mid-ocean. Sturdy men
who had faced bullets in the Civil War
without wincing, lost self-control. They
surged; they fought; they comforted
each other; they cried aloud.</p>

<p>At this moment a frightful tremor
shook the earth. The station building
gave sickening creaks; then it toppled
with a crash.</p>

<p>Yell now followed yell. The crowd,
that but now waited the joyous greetings
of friends, was battered by the
bruises of the earth and hurried by
fright into a contagious state of mania.
The bodies and faces of the people
changed almost beyond recognition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Maddened with fear, stunned by the last
concussion, they stampeded.</p>

<p>The cry rang from mouth to mouth:
"To the woods! To the hill! Home!
Home!! Home!!!" They swayed;
they rushed; they parted; they ran.
Struck as by an invisible enemy, they
fell prostrate in the powdery dust.
They picked themselves up again and
panted in their flight. A voice close to
Donny's side rang above the uproar:
"Good Lord! <i>It is an earthquake!</i>"</p><br /></td>

<span class="caption">&quot;THE PAUPER DOG.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Like birds before a tornado, the people
scattered to the right, to the left,&mdash;this
way, that, and were gone. Donny
found himself, dazed and alone, upon
the cross-ties, groping toward the oncoming
train. He thrust out his hands
and stood a moment piteously crying,
"Pap&auml;! Pap&auml;!" the most bewildered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
little fellow in all that frightened
town.</p>


<p>To crawl up the track, to meet the
train, to board her, to shriek at her,
to get to his
father, to cling
to the cow-catcher,
perhaps,
till the engineer
stopped for sheer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mercy,&mdash;this was the nearest approach
to a purpose that the child had, as he
beat along the track,
stumbling, falling,
up again, down
again, shaken by
the rolling earth,
and blinded by
darkness more awful
than he had ever
seen or thought of.</p>

<p>A strange, thin
dog, without a collar,
whined at his
feet as he pushed
on, and licked his
hand and followed
him like his own.
Huge, dim forms rushed alongside the
embankment, making unearthly sounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Dragons could not have seemed more
dreadful; but they were only cows.
Huge pine-trees bent to the earth with
rapid, vibratory motion as if a giant's
hand clutched and shook them by the
roots.</p>

</div>

<p>All the time the awful rumbling of
the earth went on; it sounded as if the
world were turning herself over, and
thrashing to and fro in a fit of anger;
before every convulsion she uttered a
roar which seemed as if it came from a
metal ball bowled along a giant alley
beneath. It reached its climax by trilling
the letter <b><i>R-r-r-r-r!</i></b> in a mighty
voice. Then came the shock.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the child was making
his way through the horror and desolation
of this scene, he felt himself clasped
in the outstretched arms of a figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hurrying from the opposite direction.
The two came together in the dark
with a jolt, and recoiled.</p>

<p>"Goramercy!" said a quavering voice.
It was the speech of the old Negro track-walker,
taking two days to get to his
dying daughter because he could not
afford the railroad ticket that would
have brought him to her in two hours.
Donny recognized the high, cracked,
pathetic tones which had addressed him
at the station.</p>

<p>"De track's busted!" panted the
Negro. "De rails is done gone twist
wid de shakes. Dey lays like er heap
ob corn-shuck in de win' up yander.
Dat ar train don' know hit, an' she'll
go to Day ob Jedgment, an' ebery soul

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, there isn't any town to warn!"
cried Donny. "It's all run off! There
isn't anything left but the earthquake
and me&mdash;and this pup&mdash;and nobody
to do anything&mdash;and my pap&auml;'s aboard
that train! Oh, what shall we do?
What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Run, honey, run!" said the old
man, more hopefully. "Mebbe we'll
head her off some ways or 'nuther.
Run for 't! Run!"</p>

<p>The dirty old black hand clasped the
tender little white one, which nestled
into it gratefully. What it meant at
that awful time not to be alone,&mdash;to
feel a human touch, to know that a
human heart beat beside you,&mdash;one
would have to be in the child's place
to understand.</p>

</div>

<div class='cap'>THE two ran, plunging up the distorted
track which swelled and
shook beneath them, toward the coming
train. As they came abreast of the
second little station, known as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
West End station of Summerville, an
idea shot like hope itself through the
confused brain of the hurrying boy.</div>

<p>"I know where the torpedoes are!"
he cried, shrilly. "The torpedoes they
put down to stop trains! I've seen
'em. I play with the superintendent's
boys sometimes. If I was bigger I
could bu'st open the doors and windows
and find 'em."</p>

<p>"I'se an ole man," shouted the Negro,
"but I'se been a tough one befo' Freedom.
I sole for two thousand dollars

<p>Whirling along, in the dark and the
uproar, the two panting figures rushed
against the little station. It was very
dark. In a lull of the raging earth the
distant whistle of the train could be
distinctly heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"In there!" cried the boy. "There!
<i>There!</i> Oh, don't you think perhaps
my pap&auml; took some <i>other</i> train? Oh,
she's coming! I'll help. I can help.
Oh, the door's too big for me!"</p>

<p>But not too big for the ragged old
arm that felled it down as an axe fells
the last rings of a stricken tree. Not
too big for the remnant of strength in
the once muscular slave. Not too big
for the fiery old heart that trouble and
toil and hunger and loneliness had
never quenched.</p>

<p>The door went down&mdash;glass crashed&mdash;another
door yielded&mdash;two wild figures
fell into the superintendent's private
office. The little one climbed like
a monkey upon a shelf he knew of, and
then the two rushed out of the rocking
building into the resounding air, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which human shrieks smote steadily, as
it was said they did all that awful night.
Again, the whistle
of the train&mdash;near
now&mdash;nearer&mdash;</p>


<p>As the pathetic
couple ran up the
torn and twisted
track, Donny began
to sob aloud; but
all he said was,
"Pap&auml;! Pap&auml;!
Pap&auml;!"</p>

<p>"Gib 'em to me,
sonny," said the
Negro, with the authority
of age and
danger. "I kin run

<span class="caption">&quot;THE OLD MAN SEIZED THE TORPEDOES.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The old man seized the torpedoes,
and rushing away with them, vanished
in the darkness. The unknown, collarless
dog followed him. Donny, sobbing
and calling his father's name, pushed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
as well as he could by himself. As he
ran he tried to say his prayers, but all
he could remember was, "Our Father
who art in heaven."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;THIS COMFORTED THE LAD INCREDIBLY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then he thought, how soon might
his father on earth be father in heaven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
too? He could not say that prayer.
The boy, like many an older and wiser
than Donny, only cried instead of praying.
As he ran along in this sad
fashion, something hit against him,
whinnying in the dark. It was Ben
Bow, the horse he had ridden ever since
he was a baby. Now, this comforted
the lad incredibly, to have one of the
family with him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>III.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE old man and the train were now
face to face. The locomotive came
cautiously, for the shocks had penetrated
far up the road, but too fast&mdash;far
too fast. Where the track had
gone to pieces, a mass of twisted rails
and tossing sleepers and furrowed
earth, a bank&mdash;what is called a high
bank in Southern topography&mdash;raised
itself just in the turn of time to
have sent the derailed train plunging
down.</div>

<p>The old Negro watched the approaching
flare of the head-light as he ran on,
with a grim, defiant eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I stump ye!" he said aloud. He
shook his trembling, black fist at the
locomotive. Stumbling along, his old
bundle over one shoulder, and the torpedoes
clutched in the other arm, being
thus encumbered&mdash;for it did not occur
to him that he could throw away his
bundle, he was so poor&mdash;he tripped and
fell. His foot caught; it is unknown
in what,&mdash;in a twisted tie, or perhaps
in a crevice of the cracking earth.</p>

<p>When he tried to rise, something
held the hero down. He reached his
whole length forward flat upon the
road-bed, and with great precision and
with a coolness that one cannot think
of now without emotion, he laid one
torpedo on each rail, exactly where it
needs must lie to give the warning
through the crushing wheel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Now for the second time the old man
and the locomotive regarded each other.
Her fiery breath was close upon him.
Above the uproar of the reeling earth
the shriek of the train sounded in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
deafened ears. Once again, the strong,
black fist was clinched in the approaching
monster's face.</p>

<p>"I dare ye!" he cried. "Come on!
I dare ye!" He pulled himself up with
a mighty wrench. But the unknown
power held him. He felt the claws of
the cow-catcher. He gave one low cry:</p>

<p>"Lord, I'd like to got dar an' seen
Juno Soo afore she died&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he closed his eyes, that he
might not see what would happen,
clasped his hands above his gray head,
and gave his manly soul to God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE anxious and bewildered passengers
heard the snap! snap! of the
torpedoes, and half of them rushed to
the platforms. The engineer signalled
"Down brakes!" and the train, with a
mighty jolt, came to a stop. A heavy
shock shook the night at that instant.
The smell of sulphur was strong in the
chilly air. The engineer got out with a
lantern. The crowd gathered in a moment.
At the brink of the scattered
track, at the very edge of wreck and
death, the train had come to a stand.</div>

<p>"Who did it?" swept from lip to
lip. No one was in sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought we hit a man," said the
engineer, swinging his lantern far out
into the darkness. But no sign, whether
of the dead or of the living, was in
sight,&mdash;nothing except a half-starved,
collarless dog, who sat stupidly upon
the grass, and who did not even wag his
tail when the stoker spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Who saved us? Who saved the
train?"</p>

<p>Ask the disappointed vulture and the
mouth of the muttering earth to tell
you, gentlemen passengers! There is
no other lip to answer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Yes, there is one; a little, trembling,
ashy lip&mdash;a child's&mdash;scarcely able to
articulate for grief or terror, and pouring
forth confused cries that nobody can
understand. The passengers have left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the train, and are making their way
cautiously homeward down the devastated
road-bed, where the track had
lain. It is hurled now to every point
of the compass in the wild night.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/gs26.jpg" width="192" height="350" alt="&quot;PAP&Auml;! PAP&Auml;!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;PAP&Auml;! PAP&Auml;!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>They come to a halt suddenly, before
a little huddling figure, with its
face hidden in its arms, crouched beside
a crooked rail. An old horse, with
traces hanging and harness a wreck,
stands snorting beside the boy.</p>

<p>"Donny! Donny! Why, my sonny
boy!"</p>

<p>The crowd parts for a thin, white-faced
man,&mdash;the passenger who had
been heard to say upon the way, "My
little son is coming to meet me. I hope
these shocks do not extend to the Summerville
station."</p>

<p>There is one other little wild call,
"Pap&auml;! Pap&auml;!"&mdash;a tremendous effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to be manly, and not cry before strangers&mdash;and
the boy melts into his
father's arms, and wonders whose tears
they are which
rain upon his
cuddling face.</p>


<p>But who saved
the train? Where
is he? How did
he do it? Who
took that noble
risk? Where is
the hero? Here?</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, my lad?"</p>

<p>Then Donny
raised his awestruck
face from
his father's quick-beating heart, and
standing among the strangers and the
neighbors, told the story,&mdash;all that he
knew; all that he could tell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only remembered the torpedoes,
sir. The old man did the rest."</p>

<p>"What old man? Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, the old colored man! Haven't
you seen him? The old colored man
who ran ahead and put them on the
track. <i>He</i> saved the train."</p>

<p>The engineer took his lantern and
silently went back and swung the spot
of fire in the black, cold air. It had
not rained, as we have said, for many
weeks, but his feet splashed into deep
pools and running rivulets, and sank
into crevices and gashes in the trembling
earth.</p>

<p>A few of the passengers followed the
engineer. The locality where the train
stood was examined thoroughly. Again,
the same result,&mdash;no human creature,
dead or living, was to be seen. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pauper dog sat just where they had left
him. The engineer went up and patted
him. At the touch he fell over&mdash;dead
of fright.</p>

<p>They returned to report what they
had found. As they did so, they called
and shouted into the darkness, seeking
for the brave life that had saved their
own. Only the roar of the earthquake
answered them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he <i>must</i> be there!" cried the
lad, "of course he's there. He's a very
shabby old Negro. He is all patches
and his knees and hair stick out. His
hat looked like a coon-skin hat. His
hair is gray hair. He carries a little
bundle on his shoulder. He's a very
strong old Negro. He smashed the
station in like&mdash;like blocks. He was a
slave, and he was so strong he cost two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thousand dollars. He's going to see
his daughter in Branchville. She's dying.
He's so poor he had to walk from
Charleston all the way. <i>He</i> saved the
train. You just look and you'll find
him."</p>


<p>A mighty shock drowned the boy's
words at this moment, and seemed to
jeer at them. The people huddled together,
and looked into each others'
appalled faces, and no man said a word.
Instinctively they ranged themselves
into a mass, as if united humanity could
defy aroused and raging Nature,&mdash;then
broke, and ran for their homes, and
wives and babes, and whatever fate had
left to them.</p>

<div class='cap'>BUT where is the hero? Who saved
the train? Summerville, to this
day, goes seeking him, and her search
is a vain thing. Will he not break his
long, mysterious silence? Will he not

grateful people? An obscure old Negro,
poor, hungry, and homeless, will he not

<p>Some weeks after the shock of August
31, a section hand, setting a sleeper,
found an old bundle, soiled and wet,
tied to a stick and mouldering in the
ground. He opened it carelessly, and
threw it away, and hardly thought to
mention it to his overseer, who had the
curiosity to pick up the rags and examine
them.</p>

<p>A handkerchief, once red, with polka
spots, contained a ragged flannel shirt
and a stocking-heel tied with a piece of
tape. That was all. This stocking-heel,
evidently the wallet of some poor
traveller, held one silver piece of the
value of ten cents, two coppers, and
a newspaper clipping, old and faded.
It was a copy of the Proclamation
of Emancipation to the Negro slaves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
America, beginning, "I, Abraham Lincoln,"
and bearing date Eighteen Hundred

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
